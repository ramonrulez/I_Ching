I Ching
The Book of Changes

For countless centuries emperor and peasant, scholar and unlearned alike have
sought to understand the timeless wisdom and eerie divinations of the I Ching,
translated, the Book of Changes. Using the simple tools of three coins, one can
seek insight from the I Chlng regarding whatever question is on one's heart.

Using the I Ching

The Question
There is a question burning in your heart and mind. Think about it and then write it down, privately, on
a piece of paper. Writing the question down helps you to focus on the precise subject being asked about,
thereby avoiding ambiguity. Be sure to word your question so that it requires a commentary type of answer ...
i.e., do not ask a question that requires a 'yes' or 'no' answer. For example, ask "What if..." or "What is
this all about...?"

Casting the Coins
With your mind focused on the question you've written down, gather three coins of the same size into your hands,
shake them until they are randomly arranged in your hand, then cast them gently upon the table in front of you.
Notice how the coins have landed with either heads or 'tails' facing up.

Building a Trigram
Match the heads or tails' pattern of the cast coins with one of the 4 patterns shown in the following table. Make
note of the associated line form next to the matched pattern and write it down. (Note that if you cast three-
of-a-kind, the line form will have a dot after it). Repeat this coin casting process 2 more times. each time placing
the next line form on top of the previous one. Having done this 3 times, you will have a 3 line figure known as a trigram.

Example trigram

3rd cast -+ - -
2nd cast -+ â€¢ 
1st cast -+ - -

Building a Hexagram
You need to create 2 trigrams to make a full hexagram. So, create a second trigram using the same
process above. When done you will have created a hexagram consisting of a lower trigram (the first one)
and an upper trigram (the second one).

Finding the Hexagram
Cross-reference the lower trigram with the upper trigram using the chart below.
For the moment, ignore any dots that may appear beside any of the line forms. Make note of the hexagram number
that the two trigrams form, and turn to the page with that number.

Interpreting the Hexagram
The hexagram you have created contains words of insight pertaining to your question. Seek to apply the
words you're given to the question you asked, in a sincere and introspective way. Suspend preconceptions
that may cloud your vision regarding the subject under consideration. Your intuition will confirm whether
or not you have been enlightened.

If your Hexagram contains any 'Dotted' line forms
You may have cast one or more "three-of-a-kind" patterns (3-heads or 3-tails), resulting in a 'dotted' line form
in your hexagram. If so, there remains further information for you from the I Ching. The dotted line means that
your hexagram is soon to undergo a change. To learn how it is going to change, you must transform the current
hexagram into its future form. You do this by converting the dotted line forms into their opposite forms, that is solid
lines become dashed lines and dashed lines become solid lines.
