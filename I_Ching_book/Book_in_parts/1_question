The Question
There is a question burning in your heart and mind. Think about it and then write it down, privately. 
Writing the question down helps you to focus on the precise subject being asked about,
thereby avoiding ambiguity. Be sure to word your question so that it requires a commentary type of answer ...
i.e., do not ask a question that requires a 'yes' or 'no' answer. For example, ask "What if..." or "What is
this all about...?"
