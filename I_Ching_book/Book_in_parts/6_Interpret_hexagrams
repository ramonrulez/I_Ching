Interpreting the Hexagram
The hexagram you have created contains words of insight pertaining to your question. Seek to apply the
words you're given to the question you asked, in a sincere and introspective way. Suspend preconceptions
that may cloud your vision regarding the subject under consideration. Your intuition will confirm whether
or not you have been enlightened.
