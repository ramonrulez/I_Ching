If your Hexagram contains any 'Dotted' line forms
You may have cast one or more "three-of-a-kind" patterns (3-heads or 3-tails), resulting in a 'dotted' line form
in your hexagram. If so, there remains further information for you from the I Ching. The dotted line means that
your hexagram is soon to undergo a change. To learn how it is going to change, you must transform the current
hexagram into its future form. You do this by converting the dotted line forms into their opposite forms, that is solid
lines become dashed lines and dashed lines become solid lines.
