    - Print the MAIN menu and ask the user:
        - ask a question, 
        - read the book,

QUESTION:
    Book Intro:
        - Print an intro about the book and how it works.(See the actual book for that)

    Question:
        - Let the user input a question.
            - Save it in a std::string (to have acces to it).
            - Print the question and ask the user if his question is right.
                - If it is continue with the execution.
                - If it is NOT let him write again the question (if you can edit the string do that).
            - Clear the screen, print the question and continue with the program.

    Coin Casting:
        - Here the user has 2 choises:
            - First is to cast the coins for himself anf input the results (ask the user if he knows how to cast them and give him instructions if he doesnt).
            - Secondly is to let the RNG give him randomly generated results (parallel casting of the coins).

    Bulding Trigram/Hexagram:
        - The results should be saved in data structures that compose 2 Trigrams and those Trigrams can compose the Hexagram.

    Finding the quote:
        - The composed Hexagram should be used in conjunction with a look-up table to find the right quote for the current Hexagram.

    Printing the quote:
        - When the reference to the quote is been completed the quote should be printed.
        - Some coin casting should compose 2 quotes, the normal quote and that that will become to.

    Ending the question:
        - Before we exit we should save the question, and the hexagram, and the time so we can later recall it.
