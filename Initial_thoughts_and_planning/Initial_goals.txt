The rules that you must follow to get answers for your question is in the I Ching book so I would not bother you with that.

After the Hexagram is complete the program will give you the passage with the number that the mother luck wants you to read.
Some requirements:
	- The user should write his questions in the program and save them for future reference.
	- The question should always be in the screen after the initial input.
	- The user should have the choise to cast and input his own coins or let the computer to do that.

Extra ideas:
