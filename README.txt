This is the I Ching
Is a book about change.
You ask a question with your soul and you let the cosmic intelligence to do it's thing.

The rules that you must follow to get answers for your question is in the I Ching book so I would not bother you with that.

The program I would like to let you choose to input your own coin cast or let the RNG(Random Number Generator) to decide.
After the Hexagram is complete the program will give you the passage with the number that the mother luck wants you to read.
For extra:
	- I think that you should read every passage if you want.
	- You should have access to the cross reference chart of the hexagrams.
	- and generally to use this program as a program or as the actual book.
	- Maybe you should write your questions in the program and to save them for future reference.
	- Maybe let the program to quote a random passage for your enjoyment.
	- Maybe to  display the hexagram symbols with their names.
